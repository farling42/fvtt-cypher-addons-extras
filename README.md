# Cypher System Character Creation Pack/Compendium for non-CSRD Material

This is a module for use in conjunction with the [Cypher System game system for Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem/).

It works with the [Cypher System Compendium](https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-compendium) to provide compendiums of journal entries for all the Types, Descriptors and Foci in the various non-CSRD books.

Each journal entry contains a link to the PDF page containing the actual description of the ability. This uses the [PDFoundry](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pdfoundry/) module to display the links and open the PDFs.

For each type/descriptor/focus/flavor there is a link for each available ability to the abilities in the Cypher SRD Compendium.

Additional markers are present which work with the Sentence Linking and Creation Tool of the [Nice(TSY) Cypher Add-Ons](https://github.com/NiceTSY/nice-cypher-add-ons) module.

## Installation

The package should be available from the Add-On Modules, Install Module option of Foundry VTT.

If you want to install it manually, then enter the following into the Manifest URL at the bottom of the "Install Module" window:

https://github.com/farling42/fvtt-cypher-addons-extras/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Hard Dependencies

[Cypher System Compendium](https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-compendium) provides compendiums of Items (such as abilities) which are linked from the sentence journal entries provided here. See this module for how to set up PDF documents to work with pages properly.

[PDFoundry](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pdfoundry/) provides the PDF viewer for the links to the documentation provided in each journal entry.

## Soft Dependency

Additional markers are placed into each of the journal entries which provide compatibility with the Creation Tool component of the [Nice(TSY) Cypher Add-Ons](https://github.com/NiceTSY/nice-cypher-add-ons) module.
